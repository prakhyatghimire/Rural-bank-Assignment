This Java-based banking application offers a comprehensive implementation of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through the simulation of real-world banking operations in a console environment. At the heart of the design is the Transaction interface, which establishes a contract for essential banking functionalities such as deposits and withdrawals. This promotes abstraction and ensures that all account types conform to a uniform structure of behavior. The abstract class BankAccount serves as a general blueprint for various types of accounts, encapsulating shared attributes such as account number, account holderâ€™s name, and balance. It provides default implementations for common methods while leaving others, such as withdraw and displayAccountInfo, to be defined specifically by subclasses. This leverages the power of abstraction and inheritance, allowing subclasses like SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount to override and specialize behavior. For instance, the SavingsAccount class incorporates an interest rate and provides functionality to calculate and add interest, reflecting a realistic banking feature. In contrast, the CurrentAccount class introduces an overdraft limit, permitting account holders to withdraw beyond their balance within predefined limits. These implementations illustrate polymorphism, as the program can operate on different account types through a common interface.

Moreover, the application emphasizes encapsulation by keeping class variables private and providing controlled access via public getters and setters. The inclusion of a custom exception class, InsufficientBalanceException, enhances robustness by handling scenarios where a withdrawal request exceeds the available balance or overdraft limit. This exception is gracefully managed within the BankApp class, which acts as the user interface, facilitating interaction through a menu-driven system that supports deposits, withdrawals, interest calculations, and account information display. The Customer class further demonstrates the principle of composition, as each customer can own multiple bank accounts, reflecting real-life banking relationships.
